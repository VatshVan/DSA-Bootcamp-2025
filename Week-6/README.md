# Week 6: Dynamic Programming

Welcome to Week 6 of the DSA Bootcamp 2025! After covering foundational topics like recursion and iterative problem solving, it's time to explore one of the most important concepts in algorithmic problem-solving: **Dynamic Programming (DP)**.

This week, we will focus on understanding, identifying, and applying DP techniques to solve complex problems efficiently.



## Topics Covered

### Introduction to Dynamic Programming
We’ll begin by understanding what makes a problem suitable for DP. We’ll explore how DP evolves from naive recursion and how to optimize both time and space.

**Start here**: [Introduction](./Introduction)



## Core DP Algorithms (Increasing Difficulty)

This week focuses on 4 carefully selected DP problems:

1. **Climbing Stairs** — Intro to DP and recurrence

2. **0/1 Knapsack** — Classic decision-making DP  
   [0/1 Knapsack](./0%5C1%20Knapsack)

3. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** — 2D state transition  
   [Longest Common Subsequence](./Longest%20Common%20Subsequence)

4. **Matrix Chain Multiplication** — Interval DP and optimization  
   [Matrix Chain Multiplication](./Matrix%20Chain%20Multiplication)



## Practice Problems

Head over to the [Practice](./Practice) for curated problems that reinforce the above algorithms.



## Additional Resources

Supplementary resources are in the [Resources Folder](./Resources).



## Final Notes

Dynamic Programming is challenging because it requires deep pattern recognition and clear thought about subproblem structure. If it feels difficult — you’re doing it right.

Good luck, and code smart.
