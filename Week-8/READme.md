# Week 8

Welcome to **Week 8**, the **final week** of the DSA Bootcamp! ðŸŽ‰  
This week is designed for **additional learning** and exploration. Weâ€™ll dive into two advanced areas that frequently appear in competitive programming and technical interviews: **Number Theory** and **String Algorithms**.

While these topics are optional, they are highly recommended for strengthening your problem-solving toolkit.

## Topics Covered (Optional & Advanced)

### Number Theory

1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**  
   Efficient preprocessing for primes and smallest prime factors.

2. **Euclid's Algorithm**  
   Computing GCD and LCM in logarithmic time.

3. **Modular Exponentiation**  
   Fast power calculation under modulo.

4. **Modular Inverse**  
   Useful in combinatorics and cryptography.

### String Algorithms

1. **Z Algorithm**  
   Linear time pattern matching.

2. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**  
   Efficient dictionary-based prefix searching.

3. **KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) Algorithm**  
   Another classic string pattern matching technique with linear time complexity.

Use this week to **explore at your own pace**, practice these advanced concepts, and push your limits a little further.
